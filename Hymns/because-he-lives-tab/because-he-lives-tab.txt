[ VERSE 1 ]
G                                 C9
God sent His Son, they called Him Je - sus;
           G                   Am7    D
He came to love, heal and for- give.
             G              C9
He lived and died to buy my par- don;
           G                 D                 G
An emp- ty grave is there to prove my Sav- ior lives

[ CHORUS ]
             G                    C9
Be- cause He lives I can face to- mor- row;
             G                 Am7    D
Be- cause He lives all fear is gone;
            G C9 G              C9
Be- cause I know   He holds the fu- ture,
            G                  D                 G      C9 G
And life is worth the liv- ing just be- cause He lives.

[ VERSE 2 ]

How sweet to hold a new- born ba- by,
And feel the pride and joy he gives;
But great- er still the calm as- sur- ance,
This child can face un- cer- tain days, be- cause He lives.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]

And then one day I'll cross the ri- ver;
I'll fight life's fi- nal war with pain;
And then as death give way to vic- t'ry,
I'll see the lights of glo- ry and I'll know He lives.

[ CHORUS ]
