            D         G     D                                  A
Be-fore the throne of God a-bove  I have a strong and per-fect plea;
             G            A       Bm              G                    D
A great High Priest whose name is Love, who ev-er lives and pleads for me.
           G              A                  G        A      Bm
My name is grav-en on His hands,  My name is writ-ten on His heart.
            G        A         Bm                    G                Bm
I know that while in heav'n He stands  No tongue can bid me thence de-part,
              G               D
No tongue can bid me thence de-part

[ VERSE 2 ]

            D         G     D                                     A
When Sa-tan tempts me to de-spair  And tells me of the guilt with-in,
          G        A       Bm                 G             D
Up-ward I look and see Him there  Who made an end of all my sin.
             G                A                G       A        Bm
Be-cause the sin-less Sav-ior died  My sin-ful soul is count-ed free;
            G       A      Bm               G               Bm
For God the just is sat-is-fied  To look on Him and par-don me,
           G               D
To look on Him and par-don me

[ VERSE 3 ]

            D          G      D                                       A
Be-hold Him there, the ris-en Lamb,  My per-fect spot-less right-eous-ness.
             G        A     Bm               G             D
The great un-change-a-ble I AM,  The King of glo-ry and of grace.
             G              A                G          A      Bm
One with Him-self I can-not die;  My soul is pur-chased by His blood.
           G        A         Bm                     G              Bm
My life is hid with Christ on high,  With Christ, my Sav-ior and my God,
                G              D
With Christ, my Sav-ior and my God.
