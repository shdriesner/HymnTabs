[ VERSE 1 ]
D                    G            D       G      A
Crown Him with man-y crowns,  The Lamb up-on His throne;
      D       G         E       A           A      E       A
Hark! how the heav'n-ly an-them drowns  All mu-sic but its own
  D                 G        E                A
A-wake my soul, and sing  Of Him who died for thee,
    D               G          D             G     A      D
And hail Him as thy match-less King  Through all e-ter-ni-ty.

[ VERSE 2 ]
Crown Him the Lord of Life,  Who tri-umphed o'er the grave,
And rose vic-to-rious in the strife   For those He came to save;
His glo-ries now we sing,  Who died and rose on high,
Who died e-ter-nal life to bring,  And lives that death may die.

[ VERSE 3 ]
Crown Him the Lord of peace,  Whose pow'r a scep-ter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease,  And all be pray'r and praise:
His reign shall know no end,  And round his pierc-ed feet
Fair flow'rs of par-a-dise ex-tend  Their fra-grance ev-er sweet.

[ VERSE 4 ]
Crown Him the Lord of love;  Be-hold His hands and side,
Those wounds, yet vis-i-ble a-bove,  In beau-ty glo-ri-fied:
All hail, Re-deem-er, hail!  For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise and glo-ry shall not fail  Though-out e-ter-ni-ty.
