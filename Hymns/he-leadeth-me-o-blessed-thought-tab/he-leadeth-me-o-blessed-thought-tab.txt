[ VERSE 1 ]   G              C
              He lead-eth me! O bless-ed tho't!
                G                    Em       D
              O words with heav'n-ly com-fort fraught!
                   G               C
              What-e'er I do, wher-e'er I be,
                     G                   D        G
              Still 'tis God's hand that lead-eth me.

[ REFRAIN ]      G        D      C        G
              He lead-eth me, He lead-eth me,
                                 Em       D
              By His own hand He lead-eth me;
                  G         D         C       G
              His faith-ful fol-l'wer I would be,
                                 D        G
              For by His hand He lead-eth me.

[ VERSE 2 ]   Some-times 'mid scenes of deep-est gloom,
              Some-times where E-den's bow-ers bloom,
              By wa-ters still, o'er trou-bled sea,
              Still 'tis His hand that lead-eth me!

[ REFRAIN ]

[ VERSE 3 ]   Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
              Nor ev-er mur-mur nor re-pine,
              Con-tent, what-ev-er lot I see,
              Since 'tis Thy hand that lead-eth me!

[ REFRAIN ]

[ VERSE 4 ]   And when my task on earth is done,
              When by Thy grace, the vic-t'ry's won,
              E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
              Since God thru' Jor-dan lead-eth me!
