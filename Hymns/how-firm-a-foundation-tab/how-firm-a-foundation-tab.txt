[ VERSE 1 ]
    G                                     D
How firm a found-a-tion, ye saints of the Lord,
   G                             D        G
Is laid for your faith in His ex-cel-lent Word!
     G                                   D
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
   G                         D        G
To you who for ref-uge to Je-sus have fled?

[ VERSE 2 ]
"Fear not! I am with thee; O be not dis-mayed,
For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
I'll strength-en thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Up-held by My right-eous om-nip-o-tent hand.

[ VERSE 3 ]
"When through fi-ery tri-als thy path-way shall lie,
My grace, all-suf-fi-cient, shall be thy sup-ply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I on-ly de-sign
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to re-fine.

[ VERSE 4 ]
"The soul that on Je-sus hath leaned for re-pose
I will not, I will not de-sert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should en-deav-or to shake
I'll ne-ver, no ne-ver, no ne-ver for-sake!"
