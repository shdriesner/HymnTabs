[ VERSE 1 ]
G                          C9
Oh Lord, my God, when I in awe-some won-der
           G       D          C9         G
Con-sid-er all the worlds Thy hands have made,
          G                 C9
I see the stars, I hear the roll-ing thun-der,
                  G       D    C9        G
Thy pow'r through-out the u-ni-verse dis-played

[ CHORUS ]
              G        C9              G
Then sings my soul, my Sav-ior God, to Thee;
               D                    G
How great thou art!  How great thou art!
              G        C9              G
Then sings my soul, my Sav-ior God, to Thee;
               Am   D               G
How great thou art!  How great thou art!

[ VERSE 2 ]
When through the woods and for-est glades I wan- der,
and hear the birds sing sweet-ly in the trees;
When I look down from loft-y moun-tain grand-eur,
and hear the brook and feel the gen-tle breeze

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
And when I think that God, His Son not spar-ing.
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on that cross, my burden glad-ly bear-ing.
He bled and died, to take a-way my sin.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
When Christ shall come with shout of ac-cla-ma-tion
and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in hum-ble ad-o-ra-tion,
and there proclaim: my God, how great Thou art!

[ CHORUS ]
