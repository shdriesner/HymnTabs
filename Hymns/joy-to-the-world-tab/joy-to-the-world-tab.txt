[ VERSE 1 ]  D                          A
             Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
                 G        A         D
             Let earth re-ceive her king;
                 D
             Let ev-'ry heart pre-pare Him room,
                 D                           A
             And heav'n and nature sing, And heav'n and nature sing,
                 D                           A   D
             And heav'n, and heav'n, and nat-ure sing.

[ VERSE 2 ]  D                         A
             Joy to the earth! the Sav-ior reigns;
                 G         A        D
             Let men their songs em-ploy;
                   D
             While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
                D                          A
             Re-peat the sound-ing joy, re-peat the sound-ing joy,
                D                       A   D
             Re-peat, re-peat the sound-ing joy.

[ VERSE 3 ]  D                        A
             No more let sins and sor-rows grow,
                 G         A        D
             Nor thorns in-fest the ground;
                D
             He comes to make His bless-ings flow
                 D                          A
             Far as the curse is found, far as the curse is found,
                 D                    A  D
             Far as, far as the curse is found.

[ VERSE 4 ]  D                             A
             He rules the world with truth and grace
                 G         A        D
             And makes the na-tions prove
                 D
             The glo-ries of His right-eous-ness,
                 D                         A
             And won-ders of His love, and won-ders of His love,
                 D                     A   D
             And won-ders, won-ders of His love.
