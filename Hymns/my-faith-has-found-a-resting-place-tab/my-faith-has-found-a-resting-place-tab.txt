[ VERSE 1 ]
   G                 C9                  G          D   G
My faith has found a rest-ing place, Not in de-vice nor creed;
  G               C9               G             D     G
I trust the Ev-er-liv-ing one, His wounds for me shall plead.

[ CHORUS ]
  G              D             C9             D
I need no o-ther ar-gu-ment, I need no oth-er plea;
   G               C9               G            D   G
It is en-ough that Je-sus died, and that He died for me.

[ VERSE 2 ]
E-nough for me that Je-sus saves, This ends my fear and doubt;
A sin-ful soul I come to Him, He'll nev-er cast me out.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
My heart is lean-ing on the Word, the liv-ing Word of God;
Sal-va-tion by my Sav-ior's name, Sal-va-tion through His blood.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
My great Phy-si-cian heals the sick, the lost He came to save;
For me His pre-cious blood He shed, For me His life He gave.

[ CHORUS ]
