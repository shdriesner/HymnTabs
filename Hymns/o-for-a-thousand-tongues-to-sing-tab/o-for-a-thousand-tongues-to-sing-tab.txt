[ VERSE 1 ]
  G
O for a thou - sand tongues to sing
                          D
My great Re - deem - er's praise,
    G                C9
the glo - ries of my God and King,
    G              D   G
The tri - umphs of his grace.

[ VERSE 2 ]
My gra - cious Mas - ter and my God,
As - sist me to pro - claim,
To spread through all the earth a â€“ broad,
The hon - ors of thy name.

[ VERSE 3 ]
Je - sus, the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sor - rows cease;
'Tis mu - sic in the sin - ner's ears;
'Tis life and health and peace.

[ VERSE 4 ]
He breaks the pow'r of can - celled sin,
He sets the pris - 'ner free;     
His blood can make the foul - est clean,
His blood a - vailed for me.
