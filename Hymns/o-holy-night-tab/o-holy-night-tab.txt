[ VERSE 1 ]  C                   F                   C
             Oh ho-ly night, The stars are bright-ly shin-ing;
                                    G7             C
             It is the night of the dear Sav-ior's birth.
	     C                     F              C
	     Long lay the world in sin and er-ror pi-ning
                        Em             B7            Em
             Till he ap-pear'd and the soul felt its worth.
               G7                 C
             A thrill of hope the wea-ry world re-joic-es
                 G7               C
             For yon-der breaks a new and glor-ious morn!
             Am           Em        Dm              Am
             Fall on your knees! Oh hear the an-gel voic-es!
                C  G7     C   F     C  G7                 C
             Oh ni-ght di-vine,  Oh night when Christ was born!
                G7       C  F    C  G7              C
             Oh night, O ho-ly,  night, Oh night di-vine!
 
[ VERSE 2 ]  C                   F                C
             Led by the light of faith se-rene-ly beam-ing,
                                         G7         C
             With glow-ing hearts by His cra-dle we stand.
	     C                    F             C
             So led by light of a star sweet-ly gleam-ing,
                           Em            B7       Em
             Here came the Wise Men from O-ri-ent land.
                 G7                C
             The King of kings lay thus in low-ly man-ger,
                G7              C
             In all our tri-als born to be our Friend.
             Am           Em           Dm           Am
             He knows our need, to our weak-ness no stran-ger.
                C  G7     C   F    C G7            C
             Be-hold your King, be-fore Him low-ly bend!
                G7        C  F     C G7            C
             Be-hold your King, be-fore Him low-ly bend!
 
[ VERSE 3 ]  C                      F           C
             Tru-ly He taught us to love one an-oth-er;
                                     G7         C
             His law is love and His gos-pel is peace.
	     C                              F            C
             Chains shall He break, for the slave is our bro-ther,
                        Em          B7              Em
             And in His name all op-pres-sion shall cease.
                   G7              C
             Sweet hymns of joy in grate-ful cho-rus raise we;
                 G7             C
             Let all with-in us praise His ho-ly name.
             Am            Em      Dm                  Am
             Christ is the Lord! O praise His name for-ev-er!
                 C   G7     C   F  C  G7          C
             His pow-er and glo-ry ev-er-more pro-claim!
                 G7         C   F  C G7           C
             His pow-er and glo-ry ev-er-more pro-claim!
