[ VERSE 1 ]
      G              C9          G                              D
There is a foun-tain filled with blood  Drawn from Im-man-uel's veins;
    G                    C9         G                      D       G
And sin-ners, plunged be-neath that flood,  Lose all their guil-ty stains:
     G                 C9            G                 D
Lose all their guil-ty stains,  Lose all their guil-ty stains;
    G                    C9         G                      D       G
And sin-ners, plunged be-neath that flood,  Lose all their guil-ty stains.

[ VERSE 2 ]
The dy-ing thief re-joiced to see  That foun-tain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,  Wash all my sins a-way:
Wash all my sins a-way,  Wash all my sins a-way;
And there may I, though vile as he,  Wash all my sins a-way.

[ VERSE 3 ]
Dear dy-ing Lamb, Thy pre-cious blood  Shall ne-ver lose its pow'r
Till all the ran-somed church of God  Be saved, to sin no more:
Be saved, to sin no more,  Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ran-somed church of God  Be saved, to sin no more.

[ VERSE 4 ]
E'er since by faith I saw the stream  Thy flow-ing wounds sup-ply,
Re-deem-ing love has been my theme,  And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,  And shall be till I die
Re-deem-ing love has been my theme,  And shall be till I die.
