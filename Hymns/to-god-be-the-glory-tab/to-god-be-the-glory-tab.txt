[ VERSE 1 ]
   G                        D              G
To God be the glo-ry, great things He hath done,
   C            G             A7          D
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
    G                      D             G
Who yield-ed His life an a-tone-ment for sin,
    C           G              D          G
And o-pened the life gate that all may go in.

[ CHORUS ]
           G                G                            D
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice!
           D                              D         G
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people re-joice!
    G                            D          G
Oh, come to the Fa-ther, through Je-sus the Son,
    C            G             D              G
And give Him the glo-ry, great things He hath done.
 
[ VERSE 2 ]
Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.
 
[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our vict'ry, when Jesus we see.

[ CHORUS ]
