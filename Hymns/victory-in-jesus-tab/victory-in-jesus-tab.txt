[ VERSE 1 ]
  D                                G                 D
I heard an old, old sto- ry, how a Sav- ior cam from glo- ry,
       D                               A7
How he gave His life on Cal- va- ry to save a wretch like me.
  D                                    G                     D
I heard a- bout His groan- ing, of His pre- cious blood's a- ton- ing,
     D                            A7               D
Then I re- pent- ed of my sin and won the vic- to- ry.

[ CHORUS ]
  D                          G             D
O vic- to- ry in Je- sus, my Sav- ior for- e -ver!
   D                            A7
He sought me and bought me with His re- deem- ing blood;
   D                            G              D
He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him.
   D                             A7                    D
He plunged me to vic- to- ry be- neath the cleans- ing flood.

[ VERSE 2 ]

I heard a- bout His heal- ing, of His cleans- ing pow'r re- veal- ing,
How He made the lame to walk a- gain and caused the blind to see.
And then I cried, "Dear Je- sus, come and heal my bro- ken spi- rit,"
And some- how Je- sus came and brought to me the vic- to- ry.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]

I heard a- bout a man- sion He has built for me in glo- ry,
And I heard a- bout the streets of gold be- yond the crys- tal sea;
A- bout the an- gels sing- ing, and the old re- demp- tion sto- ry,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of vic- to- ry.

[ CHORUS ]
