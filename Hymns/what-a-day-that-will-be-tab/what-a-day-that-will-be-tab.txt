[ VERSE 1 ]
         G
There is com - ing a day when no heart - aches shall come --
        D                          G
No more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye.
       C                                G
All is peace for - ev - er more on that hap - py gold - n shore.
       D                                 G
What a day, glo - ri - ous day that will be!

[ CHORUS ]
       C                        G
What a day that will be when my Je - sus I shall see.
      D                                    G
And I look up - on His face -- the one who saved me by His grace.
        C                                 G
When He takes me by the hand and leads me through the prom - ised land;
       D                                 G
What a day, glo - ri - ous day that will be!

[ VERSE 2 ]
            G     
There'll be no more sor - row there, no more bur - dens to bear,
        D                                  G
No more sick - ness, no more pain, no more part - ing ov - er there.
          C                          G
And for - ev - er I will be with the One who died for me.
       D                                 G
What a day, glo - ri - ous day that will be!

[ CHORUS ]
