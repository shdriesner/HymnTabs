[ VERSE 1 ]
             D                   G
What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
            D                      Asus   A
There is no more for heaven now to give
         D                          G
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
             D        Asus     A         Dsus   D
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace

[ REFRAIN 1 ]
          G                     D
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
       G       D               Asus   A
For my life is wholly bound to His
       D             Em          D             G
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing, "All is mine"
        D              Asus A    Dsus   D
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

[ TURNAROUND ]
| G  | D  | G  |

[ VERSE 2 ]
The night is dark but I am not forsaken
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
For in my need, His power is displayed

[ REFRAIN 2 ]
To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley He will lead
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

[ TURNAROUND ]
| G  | D  | G  |

[ VERSE 3 ]
No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave

[ REFRAIN 3 ]
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing, "I am free"
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

[ TURNAROUND ]
| G  | D  | G  |

[ VERSE 4 ]
With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home
And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne

[ REFRAIN 4 ]
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

[ REFRAIN 4 ]
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

[ OUTRO ]
         D          Em              D            G
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
        D              Asus A    Bm   G
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
        D              Asus A    Bm   G
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
        D              Asus A    D    G   D  G  D
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
