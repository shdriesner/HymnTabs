[ VERSE 2 ]
Thou rush-ing wind that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in heav'n a-long,  O praise Him! Al-le-lu-ia!
Thou ris-ing morn, in praise re-joice,
Ye lights of eve-ning, find a voice,

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
And all ye men of ten-der heart,
For-giv-ing oth-ers, take your part,  O sing ye! Al-le-lu-ia!
Ye who long pain and sor-row bear,
Praise God and on Him cast your care,

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
Let all things their Cre-at-or bless,
And wor-ship Him in hum-ble-ness,  O praise Him! Al-le-lu-ia!
Praise, praise the Fa-ther, praise the Son,
And praise the Spirit, Three in One,

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 5 ]
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all crea-tures here be-low;  O praise Him! Al-le-lu-ia!
Praise Him a-bove, ye heav'n-ly host;
Praise Fa-ther, Son, and Ho-ly Ghost,

[ CHORUS ]
