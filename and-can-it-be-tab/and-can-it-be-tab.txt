[ VERSE 1 ]
G          Em      C  D      G
And can it be that I  should gain
   C  D      G  D       A     D
An in-t’rest in the Sav-ior’s blood?
            G                 Em   D
Died He for me,    who caused His  pain?
    C       G      Em    D   G
For me, who Him to death pur-sued?
  D       G          C   Am  D
A-maz-ing love! How  can it  be
     G        C           D       G
That Thou, my God, should die for me?

[ CHORUS ]
          D         D7     G
A-maz-ing love! How can it be,
     C        G    C      G   D   G
That Thou, my God, should die for me!
 
[ VERSE 2 ]
He left His Fa-ther’s throne a-bove,
So free, so in-fi-nite His grace;
Emp-tied Him-self of all but  love,
And bled for Adam’s help-less race.
’Tis mer-cy all, im-mense and free;
O praise my God, it reach-es me.

[ CHORUS ]
 
[ VERSE 3 ] 
Long my im-pris-oned spir-it lay
Fast bound in sin and na-ture’s night;
Thine eye dif-fused a quick-‘ning ray,
I woke, the dun-geon flamed with light.
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth and fol-lowed Thee.
 
[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ] 
No con-dem-na-tion now I dread;
Je-sus, and all in Him is mine!
A-live in Him, my liv-ing Head,
And clothed in right-eous-ness di-vine;
Bold I ap-proach th’e–ter-nal throne
And claim the crown, through Christ, my own.

[ CHORUS ]
