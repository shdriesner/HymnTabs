[ VERSE 1 ]
            G         C9    G                                  D
Be-fore the throne of God a-bove  I have a strong and per-fect plea;
             C9           D       Em              C9                   G
A great High Priest whose name is Love, who ev-er lives and pleads for me.
           C9             D                  C9          D   Em
My name is grav-en on His hands,  My name is writ-ten on His heart.
            C9       D         Em                    C9               Em
I know that while in heav'n He stands  No tongue can bid me thence de-part,
              C9               G
No tongue can bid me thence de-part


[ VERSE 2 ]

When Sa-tan tempts me to de-spair  And tells me of the guilt with-in,
Up-ward I look and see Him there  Who made an end of all my sin.
Be-cause the sin-less Sav-ior died  My sin-ful soul is counted free;
For God the just is sat-is-fied  To look on Him and par-don me,
To look on Him and par-don me


[ VERSE 3 ]

Be-hold Him there, the ris-en Lamb,  My per-fect spot-less right-eous-ness.
The great un-change-a-ble I AM,  The King of glo-ry and of grace.
One with Him-self I can-not die;  My soul is pur-chased by His blood.
My life is hid with Christ on high,  With Christ, my Sav-ior and my God,
With Christ, my Sav-ior and my God.
