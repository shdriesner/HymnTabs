[ VERSE 1 ]
     D                     G               D               A
Come be-hold the won-drous myst'ry  in the dawn-ing of the King
       Bm7                G                           A     D
He the theme of heav-en's prais-es  robed in frail hu-man-i-ty
       G               D                  Bm7               G
In our long-ing in our dark-ness  now the light of life has come
        D                 G                          A       D
Look to Christ who con-de-scend-ed  took on flesh to ran-som us

[ TURNAROUND ]

[ VERSE 2 ]

Come be-hold the won-drous myst'ry  He the per-fect Son of Man
In His liv-ing in His suff-'ring  nev-er trace nor stain of sin
See the true and bet-ter A-dam  come to save the hell-bound man
Christ the great and sure ful-fill-ment  of the law in Him we stand

[ TURNAROUND ]

[ VERSE 3 ]

Come be-hold the won-drous myst'ry  Christ the Lord up-on the tree
In the stead of ru-in'd sin-ners  hangs the Lamb in vic-to-ry
See the price of our re-demp-tion  see the Fa-ther's plan un-fold
Bring-ing ma-ny sons to glo-ry  grace un-mea-sured love un-told

[ TURNAROUND ]

[ VERSE 4 ]

Come be-hold the won-drous myst'ry  slain by death the God of life
But no grave could e'er re-strain Him  praise the Lord He is a-live
What a fore-taste of de-liv-'rance  how un-wa-ver-ing our hope
Christ in pow-er res-ur-rect-ed  as we will be when He comes

[ OUTRO X 2 ]
       G                D                  Bm7            G
What a fore-taste of de-liv-'rance  how un-wa-ver-ing our hope
          D             G                      A       D
Christ in pow-er res-ur-rect-ed  as we will be when He comes
