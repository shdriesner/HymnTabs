[ VERSE 1 ]
           C              G                  Am       G        C
Come, Thou Fount of ev'ry bless-ing, Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
           C              G                  Am       G        C
Streams of mer-cy, nev-er ceas-ing, call for songs of loud-est praise:
         C
Teach me some me-lo-dious son-net, Sung by flam-ing tongues a-bove;
           C                   G               Am     G        C
Praise the mount! I'm fixed up-on it, Mount of Thy re-deem-ing love.
 
 
[ VERSE 2 ]
Here I raise mine Eb-e-ne-zer; Hither by Thy help I'm come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleas-ure, Safe-ly to ar-rive at home:
Je-sus sought me when a strang-er, Wan-d'ring from the fold of God;
He, to res-cue me from dan-ger, In-ter-posed his pre-cious blood.
 
 
[ VERSE 3 ]
O to grace how great a debt-or dai-ly I'm con-strained to be!
Let Thy grace, Lord, like a fet-ter, bind my wan-d'ring heart to Thee:
Prone to wan-der, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it; Seal it for Thy courts a-bove.
