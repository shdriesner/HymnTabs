Then sings my soul my Sav-ior, God, to Thee; How great thou art!  How great thou art!


2nd Verse:
==========

When through the woods and for-est glades I wan- der, and hear the birds sing sweet-ly in the trees;

When I look down from loft-y moun-tain grand-eur, and hear the brook and feel the gen-tle breeze

CHORUS

3rd verse:
==========

And when I think that God, His Son not spar-ing.  Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;

That on that cross, my burden glad-ly bear-ing.  He bled and died, to take a-way my sin.

CHORUS

4th verse:
==========

When Christ shall come with shout of ac-cla-ma-tion and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!

Then I shall bow in hum-ble ad-o-ra-tion, and there proclaim: my God, how great Thou art!

CHORUS
