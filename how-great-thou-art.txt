Oh Lord, my God, when I in awe-some won-der
           G       D          C9         G
con-sid-er all the worlds Thy hands have made.
          G                 C9
I see the stars, I hear the roll-ing thun-der.

How great thou art!  How great thou art!


2nd Verse:
==========

When through the woods and for-est glades I wan- der,
and hear the birds sing sweet-ly in the trees;
When I look down from loft-y moun-tain grand-eur,
and hear the brook and feel the gen-tle breeze

CHORUS

3rd verse:
==========

And when I think that God, His Son not spar-ing.
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on that cross, my burden glad-ly bear-ing.
He bled and died, to take a-way my sin.

CHORUS

4th verse:
==========

When Christ shall come with shout of ac-cla-ma-tion
and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in hum-ble ad-o-ra-tion,
and there proclaim: my God, how great Thou art!

CHORUS
