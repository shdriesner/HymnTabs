[ VERSE 1 ]

            D               A                G         A            D
In Christ a-lone my hope is found;  He is my light, my strength, my song;
             D                  A                         G         A           D
This cor-ner-stone, this so-lid ground,  Firm through the fierc-est drought and storm.
                G                    A
what heights of love, what depths of peace,
               G                        A
When fears are stilled, when striv-ings cease;
           D              A                 G       A        D
My Com-for-ter, my All in All;  Here in the love of Christ I stand.
 
 
[ VERSE 2 ]

In Christ alone, who took on flesh;  Full-ness of God in help-less babe.
This gift of love and right-eous-ness  Scorned by the ones he came to save;
'Til on that cross where Jesus died,  The wrath of God was sat-is-fied.
For ev-ery sin on Him was laid;  Here in the death of Christ I live.
 
 
[ VERSE 3 ]

There in the ground His body lay;  Light of the world in dark-ness slain. 
Then burst-ing forth in glorious day,  Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in vict-o-ry,  Sin's curse has lost its grip on me;
For I am His and He is mine,  Bought with the pre-cious blood of Christ.
 
 
[ VERSE 4 ]

No guilt in life, no fear in death;  This is the pow'r of Christ in me. 
From life's first cry to fi-nal breath  Jesus com-mands my des-ti-ny. 
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,  Can e-ver pluck me from His hand;
'Til He re-turns or calls me home,  Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand!
