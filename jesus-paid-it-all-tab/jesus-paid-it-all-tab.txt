[ VERSE 1 ]
 
  D                         A                   D
I hear the Sav-ior say  Thy strength in-deed is small.
         D                                          A      D
Child of weak-ness watch and pray  Find in me thine all in all.
 
[ CHORUS ]
 
D                                A
Jesus paid it all.  All to Him I owe.
D                      G
Sin had left a crimson stain,
   D         A        D
He washed it white as snow.
 
[ VERSE 2 ]
 
Lord, now in-deed I find  Thy power and thine a-lone
Can change the lep-er's spots  And melt the heart of stone
 
[ CHORUS ]
 
[ VERSE 3 ]
 
For noth-ing good have I  Where by Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my gar-ments white  In the blood of Cal-v'ry's Lamb
 
[ CHORUS ]
 
[ VERSE 4 ]

And when, be-fore the throne,  I stand in Him com-plete,
"Je-sus died my soul to save,"  My lips will still re-peat.

[ CHORUS ]
