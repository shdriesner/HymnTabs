D                                                     A  D
What can wash a-way my sin? Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus;
D                                                        A  D
What can make me whole a-gain? Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.

[ CHORUS ]
D                          A
Oh, pre-cious is the flow, that makes me white as snow;
D                                                 A  D
No o-ther fount I know, Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus

[ VERSE 2 ]
For my par-don this I see, Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus;
For my cleans-ing, this my plea, Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Noth-ing can for sin a-tone, Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus;
Naught of good that I have done, Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
This is all my hope and peace, Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus;
This is all my right-eous-ness, Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.
