[ VERSE 1 ]

  G                      C9          D
O wor-ship the King, all glo-rious a-bove,
    G                             D   G
And grate-ful-ly sing His won-der-ful love;
    D
Our Shield and De-fen-der, the An-cient of Days,
   G                                   D    G
Pa-vil-ioned in splen-dor, and gird-ed with praise.


[ VERSE 2 ]

O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
Whose robe is the light, whose can-o-py space!
His char-iots of wrath the deep thun-der-clouds form,
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

[ VERSE 3 ]

Thy boun-ti-ful care what tongue can re-cite?
It breathes in the air, it shine in the light;
It streams from the hills, it de-scends to the plain,
And sweet-ly dis-tills in the dew and the rain.

[ VERSE 4 ]

Frail chil-dren of dust, and fee-ble as frail,
In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail:
Thy mer-cies how ten-der, how firm to the end;
Our Ma-ker, De-fend-er, Re-deem-er, and Friend!
