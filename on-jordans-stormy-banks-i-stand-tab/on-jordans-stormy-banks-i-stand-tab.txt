[ VERSE 1 ]

   D                 G                 D               A
On Jor-dan's storm-y banks I stand and cast a wish-ful eye
   D                                            A         D
To Ca-naan's fair and hap-py land, where my pos-ses-sions lie 

[ CHORUS ]

     D                       G          D                       A
I am bound for the prom-ised land, I am bound for the prom-ised land
  D                                                A         D
O who will come and go with me? I am bound for the prom-ised land.

[ VERSE 2 ]

All o'er those wide ex-tend-ed plains shines one e-ter-nal day;
There God the Son for-e-ver reigns and scat-ters night a-way.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]

No chill-ing winds not poi-s'nous breath can reach that health-ful shore
Sick-ness and sor-row, pain and death are felt and feared no more.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ]

When shall I reach that hap-py place and be for-ev-er blest?
When shall I see my Fa-ther's face and in His bo-som rest?

[ CHORUS ]
