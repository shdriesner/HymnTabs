Bm           D             G        D
Who else com-mands all the hosts of heaven

What other beauty demands such praises
What other splendour outshines the sun
What other majesty rules with justice
Only a Holy God

What other power can raise the dead
What other name remains undefeated

Who else would offer His only Son
