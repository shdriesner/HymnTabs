[ VERSE 1 ]

D                          A            G           A D
Praise to the Lord, the Al-might-y, the King of cre-a-tion!
D                         A         G              A  D
O my soul praise Him, for He is thy health and sal-va-tion!
D          G      D                      A
All ye who hear,  Now to His temple draw near;
G                       A  D
Praise Him in glad ad-o-ra-tion!

[ VERSE 2 ]

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so won-drous-ly reign-eth.
Shel-ters thee un-der His wings, yea, so gent-ly sus-tain-eth!
Hast thou not seen  How thy de-sires e'er have been
Grant-ed in what He or-dain-eth?

[ VERSE 3 ]

Praise to the Lord, who doth pros-per thy work and de-fend thee;
Sure-ly His good-ness and mer-cy here dai-ly at-tend thee.
Pon-der a-new  What the Al-might-y can do
If with His love He be-friend thee.

[ VERSE 4 ]

Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me a-dore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now with prais-es be-fore Him.
Let the A-men  Sound from His peo-ple a-gain;
Glad-ly for aye we a-dore Him!
