[ VERSE 1 ]

G                    C9      G          C9        G            Em    D
Speak, O Lord, as we come to You  To re-ceive the food of Your Ho-ly Word
G                         C9      G              C9       G          D    G
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;  Shape and fash-ion us in Your like-ness,
         D        G               C9      G
That the light of Christ might be seen to-day
       D       G            C9       D
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
G                       C9      G            C9      G           D   G
Speak, Oh Lord, and ful-fill in us  All Your pur-pos-es for Your glo-ry.

[ VERSE 2 ]

Teach us, Lord, full o-be-di-ence,  Ho-ly rev-er-ence, true hu-mil-i-ty;
Test our thoughts and our at-ti-tudes  In the ra-di-ance of your pur-i-ty.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your ma-jes-tic love and au-thor-i-ty.
Words of pow'r than can nev-er fail,  Let their truth pre-vail o-ver un-be-lief.

[ VERSE 3 ]

Speak, O Lord, and re-new our minds;  Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us.
Truths un-changed from the dawn of time  That will e-cho down through e-ter-ni-ty.
And by grace we'll stand on Your prom-is-es
And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, 'til Your church is built  And the earth is filled with Your glo-ry.
