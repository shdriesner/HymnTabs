[ VERSE 1 ]

      A                     D                    A               E
Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer, That calls me from a world of care
    A             D                     A                E       A
And bids me at my Fa-ther's throne make all my wants and rich-es known!
   A                                                           E
In sea-sons of dis-tress and grief my soul has of-ten found re-lief,
    A                D                   A                  E       A
And oft es-caped the temp-ter's snare by thy re-turn, sweet hour of prayer.

[ VERSE 2 ]

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer, Thy wings shall my pe-ti-tion bear
To Him whose truth and faith-ful-ness en-gage the wait-ing soul to bless:
And since He bids me seek His face, be-lieve His word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him mine ev-'ry care, and wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer.

[ VERSE 3 ]

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer, may I thy con-so-la-tion share,
Till, from Mount Pis-gah's lofty height, I view my home and take my flight:
This robe of flesh I'll drop and rise to seize the e-ver-last-ing prize;
And shout, while pass-ing through the air,
  "Fare-well, fare-well, sweet hour of prayer!"
