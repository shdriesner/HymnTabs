[ VERSE 1 ]
            G                                           D            G
The love of God is great-er far          Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
            G                                         D              G
It goes bey-ond the high-est star        And reach-es to the low-est hell;
            C9                    G                   D      G
The guilt-y pair, bowed down with care,  God gave His Son to win;
            C9               G                         D        G
His err-ing child, He rec-on-ciled       And par-doned from his sin.

[ CHORUS ]
           C9                G                        D        G
Oh love of God, how rich and pure,       How meas-ure-less and strong
             C9            G                             D        G
It shall for-e-ver-more en-dure,         The saints' and ang-els' song.

[ VERSE 2 ]
When years of time shall pass a-way      And earth-ly thrones and king-doms fall,
When men who here re-fuse to pray,       On rocks and hills and moun-tains call,
God's love so sure shall still en-dure,  All mea-sure-less and strong;
Re-deem-ing grace to Ad-am's race-       The saints and an-gels' song.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Could we with ink, the o-cean fill,      And were the skies, of parch-ment made,
Were ev-'ry stalk on earth a quill,      And ev-'ry man, a scribe by trade,
To write the love of God a-bove          Would drain the o-cean dry;
Nor could the scroll con-tain the whole, Tho' stretched from sky to sky.

[ CHORUS ]
