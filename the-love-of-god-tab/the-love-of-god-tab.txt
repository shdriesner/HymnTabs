[ Verse 1 ]

G                                                       D            G
The love of God is great-er far          Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
            G                                         D              G
It goes bey-ond the high-est star        And reach-es to the low-est hell;
            C9                    G                   D      G
The guilt-y pair, bowed down with care,  God gave His Son to win;
            C9               G                         D        G
His err-ing child, He rec-on-ciled       And par-doned from his sin.


[ Chorus ]

           C9                G                        D        G
Oh love of God, how rich and pure,       How meas-ure-less and strong
             C9            G                             D        G
It shall for-e-ver-more en-dure,         The saints' and ang-els' song.


[ Verse 2 ]

              G                                       D                     G
When years of time shall pass a-way      And earth-ly thrones and king-doms fall,
             G                                        D                    G
When men who here re-fuse to pray,       On rocks and hills and moun-tains call,
              C9                  G                   D        G
God's love so sure shall still en-dure,  All mea-sure-less and strong;
            C9               G                          D        G
Re-deem-ing grace to Ad-am's race-       The saints and an-gels' song.


[ Chorus ]


[ Verse 3 ]

              G                                       D                    G
Could we with ink, the o-cean fill,      And were the skies, of parch-ment made,
            G                                       D                G
Were ev-'ry stalk on earth a quill,      And ev-'ry man, a scribe by trade,
             C9            G                             D      G
To write the love of God a-bove          Would drain the o-cean dry;
              C9                  G                          D      G
Nor could the scroll con-tain the whole, Tho' stretched from sky to sky.
