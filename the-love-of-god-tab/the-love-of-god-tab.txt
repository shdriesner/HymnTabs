[ Verse 1 ]

D                                                       A            D
The love of God is great-er far          Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
            D                                         A              D
It goes bey-ond the high-est star        And reach-es to the low-est hell;
            G                     D                   A      D
The guilt-y pair, bowed down with care,  God gave His Son to win;
            G                D                         A        D
His err-ing child, He rec-on-ciled       And par-doned from his sin.


[ Chorus ]

           G                 D                        A        D
Oh love of God, how rich and pure,       How meas-ure-less and strong
             G             D                             A        D
It shall for-e-ver-more en-dure,         The saints' and ang-els' song.


[ Verse 2 ]

              D                                       A                     D
When years of time shall pass a-way      And earth-ly thrones and king-doms fall,
             D                                        A                    D
When men who here re-fuse to pray,       On rocks and hills and moun-tains call,
              G                   D                   A        D
God's love so sure shall still en-dure,  All mea-sure-less and strong;
            G                D                          A        D
Re-deem-ing grace to Ad-am's race-       The saints and an-gels' song.


[ Chorus ]


[ Verse 3 ]

              D                                       A                    D
Could we with ink, the o-cean fill,      And were the skies, of parch-ment made,
            D                                       A                D
Were ev-'ry stalk on earth a quill,      And ev-'ry man, a scribe by trade,
             G             D                             A      D
To write the love of God a-bove          Would drain the o-cean dry;
              G                   D                          A      D
Nor could the scroll con-tain the whole, Tho' stretched from sky to sky.
