[ VERSE 1 ]
     G                         C9
On a hill far a-way,  stood an old rug-ged cross,
    D                         G
The em-blem of suf-f'ring and shame;
      G                              C9
And I love that old cross  where the dear-est and best
      D             D7           G
For a world of lost sin-ners was slain.

[ CHORUS ]
        D7                       G
So I'll cher-ish the old rug-ged cross,
                    [cross,  the old rug-ged cross,]
        C9                      G
Till my tro-phies at last I lay down
       G                        C9
I will cling to the old rug-ged cross
                    [cross, the old rug-ged cross,]
       G              D         G
And ex-change it some-day for a crown.

[ VERSE 2 ]
Oh, that old rug-ged cross,  so de-spised by the world,
Has a won-drous at-trac-tion for me;
For the dear Lamb of God  left His glo-ry a-bove
To bear it to dark Cal-va-ry.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
In the old rug-ged cross,  stained with blood so di-vine,
Such a won-der-ful beau-ty I see;
For 'twas on that old cross  Je-sus suf-fered and died
To par-don and sanc-ti-fy me.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
To the old rug-ged cross  I will ev-er be true;
Its shame and re-proach glad-ly bear.
Then He'll call me some-day  to my home far a-way,
Where His glo-ry for-ev-er I'll share.

[ CHORUS ]
