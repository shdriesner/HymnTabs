[ VERSE 1 ]
   D                A
My hope is built on no-thing less
     G                 A          D
than Je-sus' blood and right-eous-ness
  D                  A
I dare not trust the sweet-est frame,
    G               A       D
But whol-ly lean on Je-sus' name

[ CHORUS ]
   D                  G
On Christ, the sol-id rock I stand
    D                         A
All oth-er ground is sink-ing sand
    G                A        D
All oth-er ground is sink-ing sand

[ VERSE 2 ]

When dark-ness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His un-chang-ing grace;
In ev'ry high and storm-y gale,
my anchor holds with-in the veil. 

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]

His oath, His cov-e-nant, His blood
Sup-port me in the whelm-ing flood;
When all a-round my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ]

When He shall come with trump-et sound,
Oh may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His right-eous-ness a-lone,
Fault-less to stand be-fore the throne.

[ CHORUS ]
