   D                A                  G                 A          D
My hope is built on no-thing less than Je-sus' blood and right-eous-ness
  D                  A                    G               A       D
I dare not trust the sweet-est frame, But whol-ly lean on Je-sus' name


[ Chorus ]

   D                  G
On Christ, the sol-id rock I stand
    D                         A
All oth-er ground is sink-ing sand
    G                A        D
All oth-er ground is sink-ing sand


[ Verse 2 ]

When dark-ness seems to hide His face, I rest on His un-chang-ing grace;
In ev'ry high and storm-y gale, my anchor holds with-in the veil. 


[ Chorus ]


[ Verse 3 ]

His oath, His cov-e-nant, His blood sup-port me in the whelm-ing flood;
When all a-round my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.


[ Chorus ]


[ Verse 4 ]

When He shall come with trump-et sound, oh may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His right-eous-ness a-lone, Fault-less to stand be-fore the throne.


[ Chorus ]
