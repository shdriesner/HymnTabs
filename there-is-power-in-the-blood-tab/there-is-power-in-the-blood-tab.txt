G                          C9         G
Would you be free from the bur-den of sin?

There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
G                      C9        G
Would you o'er e-vil a vic-to-ry win?

There is power,           power,  won-der-work-ing power
[There is power, there is power,]
       D                           G
In the blood                of the Lamb
             [In the blood]             [of the Lamb]	     
         G                        C9               G
There is power,           power,  won-der-work-ing power
[There is power, there is power,]
       D7                     G
In the pre-cious blood of the Lamb

[ VERSE 2 ]
Would you be free from your pas-sion and pride?
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
Come for a cleans-ing from Cal-va-ry's tide;
There's won-der-ful pow'r in the blood.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Would you be whi-ter, much whi-ter than snow?
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
Sin stains are lost in its life-giv-ing flow;
There's won-der-ful pow'r in the blood.

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
Would you do ser-vice for Je-sus your King?
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
Would you live dai-ly His prais-es to sing?
There's won-der-ful pow'r in the blood.

[ CHORUS ]
