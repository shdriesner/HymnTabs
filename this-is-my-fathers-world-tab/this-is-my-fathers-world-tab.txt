[ VERSE 1 ]

     D                           G                A
This is my Fa-ther's world,  And to my lis-t'ning ears,
    D                                             A      D
All na-ture sings, and round me rings  The mu-sic of the spheres.
     D                         G              D
This is my Fa-ther's world,  I rest me in the thought
   D                                                 A        D
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;  His hand the won-ders wrought.

[ VERSE 2 ]

This is my Fa-ther's world,  The birds their car-ols raise;
The morn-ing light, the lil-y white  De-clare their Ma-ker's praise.
This is my Fa-ther's world,  He shines in all that's fair;
In the rust-ling grass I hear Him pass,  He speaks to me ev-'ry-where.

[ VERSE 3 ]

This is my Fa-ther's world,  O let me ne'er for-get
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,  God is the ru-ler yet.
This is my Fa-ther's world,  The battle is not done;
Je-sus who died shall be sat-is-fied,  And earth and heav'n be one.
