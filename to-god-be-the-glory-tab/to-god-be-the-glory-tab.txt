=====================================

[ No capo ]


[ Verse 1 ]

   G                        D              G
To God be the glo-ry, great things He hath done,
   C            G             A7          D
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
    G                      D             G
Who yield-ed His life an a-tone-ment for sin,
    C           G              D          G
And o-pened the life gate that all may go in.


[ Chorus ]

           G                G                            D
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice!
           D                              D         G
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people re-joice!
    G                            D          G
Oh, come to the Fa-ther, through Je-sus the Son,
    C            G             D              G
And give Him the glo-ry, great things He hath done.
 

[ Verse 2 ]

Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.
 

[ Repeat Chorus ]

 
[ Verse 3 ]

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.


[ Repeat Chorus ]
