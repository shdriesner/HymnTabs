[ VERSE 1 ]
D                        G       D                         A 
What a friend we have in Je-sus, all our sins and grief to bear! 
D                     G      D      A               D 
What a pri-vi-lege to car-ry ev-'ry-thing to God in prayer!
A                       D         G        D                 A
Oh, what peace we often for-feit, oh, what need-less pain we bear
D                      G      D      A               D 
All be-cause we do not car-ry ev-'ry-thing to God in prayer.

[ VERSE 2 ]
Have we tri-als and temp-ta-tions? Is there trou-ble an-y-where?
We should ne-ver be dis-cour-aged, take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faith-ful? Who will all our sor-rows share?
Jesus knows our ev-'ry weak-ness, take it to the Lord in prayer.

[ VERSE 3 ]
Are we weak and heav-y la-den, cum-bered with a load of care?
Pre-cious Sav-ior, still our ref-uge; take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends de-spise for-sake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer.
In His arms He'll take and shield thee, thou wilt find a so-lace there.
