[ VERSE 1 ]
D                  G         D
When I sur-vey the won-drous cross
D            G         D      A
On which the Prince of Glo-ry died,
D                  G         D
My rich-est gain I count but loss,
D            A               D
And pour con-tempt on all my pride. 

[ VERSE 2 ]

For-bid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sac-ri-fice then to His blood.

[ VERSE 3 ]

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sor-row and love flow min-gled down;
did e're such love and sor-row meet,
Or thorns com-pose so rich a crown?

[ VERSE 4 ]

Were the whole realm of na-ture mine,
That were a pres-ent far too small;
Love so a-maz-ing, so di-vine,
De-mands my soul, my life, my all!
